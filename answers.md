- **b.** What are the recurrences for the Work and Span of this solution? What are their Big Oh solutions?

  W(n) = W(n-1) + 1
    
  in O(n)

  S(n) = S(n-1) + 1
  
  in O(n)
  
  
  
- **d.**

  W(n) = 2W(n/2) + n
  
  S(n) = S(n/2) + 1





- **f.**
  W(n) = 2W(n/2) + n
  
  in O(n * log n)
  
  S(n) = S(n/2) + 1
  
  in O(log n)
