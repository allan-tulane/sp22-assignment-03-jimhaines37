- **b.** What are the recurrences for the Work and Span of this solution? What are their Big Oh solutions?

  W(n) = W(n-1) + 1
    
    
    W(n) = O(n)

    
  S(n) = S(n-1) + 1
  
    S(n) = O(n)
  
    
    
    The parens_match_iterative() function 
  
  --> O(n)
  
  S(n) = ... --> O(...)
  




- **d.**

  W(n) = ...
  S(n) = ...





- **f.**
  W(n) = ... --> O(...)
  S(n) = ... --> O(...)
